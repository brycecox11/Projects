☁️ Cloud Security Projects

Welcome to my Cloud Security Projects repository! This repo showcases hands-on work focused on securing cloud environments across AWS, Azure, and hybrid platforms. Each project reflects real-world scenarios and aligns with best practices in identity and access management (IAM), network security, monitoring, compliance, and incident response.

🔐 About

As part of my journey in cloud and cybersecurity, I built this repository to explore, implement, and document security configurations, automation, and policies that improve cloud posture. Projects are designed to reflect both certification-based learning (e.g., CompTIA Security+, AWS/Azure security certifications) and practical, job-ready skills.

🧰 Projects Included

**AWS IAM Cloud Security Project**: Fine-grained policies for controlling EC2 access, tagging, and group-level permissions using IAM best practices.

🧠 Learning Focus

Least privilege and access control

Secure cloud architecture

Threat detection and alerting

Compliance frameworks (e.g., CIS, NIST)

Real-world attack simulation and response
