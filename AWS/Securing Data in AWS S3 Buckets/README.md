# 🔐 Securing Data in AWS S3 Buckets

This project demonstrates how to securely configure and manage **Amazon S3 buckets** to protect data in the cloud. It covers key security best practices including access control, encryption, and audit logging.

## 📌 Project Overview

Amazon S3 is a scalable object storage service, but without proper configuration, data can be left exposed. This project walks through:

- Creating an S3 bucket with security-first settings
- Implementing **bucket policies** to control access
- Enabling **encryption at rest** using SSE-KMS
- Turning on **bucket versioning** for data protection
- Enabling **server access logging** for auditing and visibility

## 🧠 Concepts Learned

- How to prevent public access to S3 buckets
- Writing and applying secure bucket policies
- Enforcing encryption and managing KMS keys
- Using versioning to protect against accidental deletes
- Capturing and analyzing access logs

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Amazon S3

- Amazon KMS

- AWS Console

- JSON Bucket Policies
